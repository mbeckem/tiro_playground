The following instructions assume a reasonably up-to-date Linux or Unix system.

## Building from source

As the step, use git to clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mbeckem/tiro.git
```

### Requirements

The following tools must be installed on your system to build tiro:

-   A C++17 compiler. The following compilers are tested regularly:

    -   gcc 8, 9 (Linux )
    -   clang 9, 10 (Linux)
    -   xcode 11 (OSX)

    MSVC is currently not supported (minor adjustments are necessary to make tiro compile). clang-cl should work.

-   CMake >= 3.13

No other external tools or libraries are needed.
Library dependencies needed by tiro (listed [here](https://github.com/mbeckem/tiro#dependencies)) will be fetched automatically during the build.

### Building and installing

Create a build directory, configure cmake and then run your build system.

The following example performs a _system wide_ installation of tiro.  
You can chose a custom location by specifying `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/install/prefix`.

```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTIRO_LTO=1 ..
$ make -j8
$ make install
```

The following cmake variables can be useful to customize the build process:

| CMake Variable            | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TIRO_LTO = ON \| OFF      | Optional (off by default). Attempts to enable link time optimization, if supported by the compiler. Results in smaller and more optimized output and is recommended in release builds. |
| TIRO_WARNINGS = ON \| OFF | Optional (off by default). Enables pedantic warnings, mainly used during development.                                                                                                  |
| TIRO_TESTS= ON \| OFF     | Optional (off by default). Also build test executables when enabled (placed into `build/bin`).                                                                                         |

After the build has completed, the compiled output can be found in your install prefix:

```plain
<install prefix>
|-- include
|   |-- tiro        # C headers for libtiro.so
|   `-- tiropp      # C++ headers for libtiro.so
`-- lib
    |-- cmake       # CMake support scripts
    `-- libtiro.so  # tiro as a shared library
```

### Create a simple test program

Create a simple program that links against tiro and prints its current version:

<span class="caption">Example: hello.c</span>

```c
#include <tiro/version.h>

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello from %s\n", tiro_full_version());
}
```

Now compile and run your application. Make sure that `libtiro.so` and `tiro/version.h` can be found by your compiler.

```
$ gcc hello.c -o hello -ltiro
$ ./hello
Hello from tiro 0.1.0-dev (git:ae107e2bc05173d8dfa49de21094252271de133a)
```
